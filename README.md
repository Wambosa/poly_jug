_didn't i already try to unify all database interfaces? ah what the hell, trying again_

### What im supposed to do
- interface with relational mySql, sqlite, MSsql

### Whats probably going to happen
- sqlite3
- maybe mysql


### notes
- ive done this before if i can find my old code
- sqlite will be the base language, possibly converted into mysql/mssql
- build a complete type list for sqlite mysql and msql. chances are it is already in another sql repo

### future
- need to deal with all the database types cleverly (most likely using reflect + switching)
- query lang conversion, that was fun
